## Description

A small application that was created as a final project on subject: "Operational research and complexity theory" at second year of computer science. The whole application is written in React using TypeScript and Redux. The main goal of the project was the implementation of the Min Max algorithm that makes decisions of the bot player. The application allows you to play in both single and multi-player mode. You can find the working version of XOXO [here][1] or play with it on your computer.
